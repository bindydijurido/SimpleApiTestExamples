# Simple Api Tests Examples
REST API automated test with java+rest assured

# Hello guys!

This is Sample REST API tests. I used Fake Online REST API JSONPlaceholder (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com).

If you are interested how it works maybe you should check README file which can be found here: 
https://github.com/typicode/jsonplaceholder#how-to

In this repository I am using several libraries and tools:

- Java SE Development Kit 8 - jdk8u131 - http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
- jUnit 4.12 - https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/junit/junit/4.12
- IntelliJ Community 2018.3 - https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/?fromMenu
- Rest Assured 3.3.0 - https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.rest-assured/rest-assured
- JSON.simple 1.1.1 - https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.googlecode.json-simple/json-simple
- Jackson Databind 2.9.5 - https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.fasterxml.jackson.core/jackson-databind

You can download everything manually as a zip file and open a project or simply import this repository. 
Don't worry about libraries - everything is in gradle : )
